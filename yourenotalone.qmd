# You are not alone

In the era of computational science, the roles of scientific modeller
and data scientist are inseparable from that of a software developer.
Off-the-shelf commercial software rarely addresses the unique needs of
every specialized research model, so scientists often find themselves
building or adapting code to fit their specific requirements.

Like many in the field, you may have developed your programming skills
out of necessity rather than through formal education. Most academic
programs offer only minimal training in programming—typically just
enough for basic data analysis or simple simulations, but not for
developing complex and maintainable software. 

This means you are often solely responsible for creating, debugging,
maintaining, and expanding your computational models. If you’re
fortunate, you are part of a supportive team where you can share
experiences, frustrations, and discuss different modelling approaches,
but many researchers face these technical challenges on their own.

As a result, researchers often end up working in a highly individualistic
manner, prioritizing scientific discoveries and the advancement of
knowledge over the craft of software engineering. The primary focus
becomes achieving results and fulfilling research objectives, since
those are the things you are hired for.  While this approach can be
innovative and agile, the resulting code is often difficult to maintain,
scale or share. This reinforces the habit of working in isolation rather than
prioritizing collaboration or best practices in software development.

Against this backdrop, what can improving software skills offer to the
lone, individualistic,  modeller beyond abstract “best practices”? The
answer is simple: developing robust coding skills directly leads to
more impactful, efficient, and personally rewarding research. Because,
you are not alone!

Moving beyond an individualistic mindset and embracing a more
collective approach can be truly transformative—both for you and the
community. Sharing your knowledge and code, collaborating with peers,
do more than contribute to the broader field; they accelerate your own
learning and success. Working openly with others exposes you to new
perspectives, more efficient techniques, and innovative solutions to
complex problems.

Collaboration also enhances the robustness and reliability of your
research. Colleagues and collaborators can spot errors, suggest
improvements, and help validate your results, increasing the
credibility and impact of your work. By joining forces with others,
you gain access to a broader range of expertise, making it easier to
tackle ambitious projects that might be overwhelming alone.

Furthermore, being part of a collaborative community opens doors to
valuable networking opportunities, potential partnerships, and new
projects. It fosters a culture of mutual support, where knowledge is
shared and challenges are overcome collectively. Ultimately, seeing
yourself as part of a larger, interconnected network not only advances
your own research but also propels the progress of the entire field.
In embracing collaboration, you find that the rewards—professional,
intellectual, and personal—are far greater than the sum of individual
efforts. If only the others would just understand your code.

But it is not all about how you benefit. Perhaps the most immediate and
personal incentive for improving coding skills is the profound benefit
to “your future self.” Every modeller has experienced the agony of
revisiting old code, only to be perplexed by cryptic variable names,
tangled logic, or the dreaded “final_v2_reallyfinal.py.” By adopting
better practices—such as clear naming, meaningful comments, version
control, and tidy organization—you transform code from a messy trail
to a clear roadmap. This means that when deadlines loom, manuscripts
need revision, or new questions arise, you can rapidly understand
and extend your own work rather than restarting from scratch. Clean,
well-documented code is a gift to yourself, sparing you hours of confusion
and frustration later.

It’s easy to think of coding skills as simply the ability to
write functional code, but truly effective scientific modelling
goes much further. Good coding practice isn’t just about the code
you write; it’s about how you organize, track, and communicate
your work. Good documentation, for example, helps others—and your
future self—understand what your code does and why you made certain
choices. Version control allows you to experiment freely while keeping
an organized history of your changes, making it easy to revert mistakes
or collaborate with others. Testing, on the other hand, ensures your
model behaves as expected, giving you confidence in your results.

While writing code is an essential starting point, these practices
are what transform code from a personal tool into a robust, reliable,
and valuable resource for scientific progress.  If you focus only on
getting your code to run, you might achieve results in the short term, but
investing time in these broader skills pays dividends in reproducibility,
efficiency, and collaboration.
