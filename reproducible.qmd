# Reproducible Research

Reproducible research is the practice of organizing and documenting data,
code, and methods so that others can independently recreate the same
results from the same materials.

In recent years, the integrity and reliability of scientific research
have faced growing scrutiny across disciplines. Increasingly, the
scientific community recognizes that progress hinges not only on the
novelty of results, but also on the transparency and reproducibility of
the research underlying those results. Reproducibility—the capability
for others to independently confirm results using the same data, code,
and methods—is no longer optional. It is the minimum standard for
reliable scientific work (@peng_reproducible_2011).

Too often, scientific findings cannot be replicated because the
underlying data or computational steps are inaccessible or poorly
documented. This erodes trust and stalls the advancement of knowledge. The
@turing_2019 offers a practical manifesto for change,
outlining steps researchers can take to embed reproducibility into
their everyday practice. These principles, while simple in concept,
are transformative in their effect.

A cornerstone of reproducible research is automation: using scripts
and workflow management tools to carry out analyses reduces manual
errors and makes the research process transparent. As described in
[Chapter @sec-goodcodingpractices] and [Chapter @sec-testingvalidation],
automating analysis not only streamlines work, but also enables reliable
testing and validation of results.

Equally vital is thorough documentation. Documenting your
choices—how data were obtained and cleaned, which methods and
tools were used—ensures transparency and supports both your future
self and your colleagues. This principle connects directly to 
[Chapter @sec-documentation], where practical
guidance is offered for keeping project and code documentation up-to-date.

Finally, robust version control (see [Chapter @sec-versioncontrol])
should become a staple in every researcher’s toolkit. By tracking
changes to code and documentation, version control systems like Git
support collaborative work and make it easier to identify and correct
errors introduced during development. This practice also complements
team workflows described in Deployment, Maintenance & Collaboration.
